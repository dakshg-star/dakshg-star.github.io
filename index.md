## Favorite CPSC 120L Lab Assignments

Lab 5 Part 1
I really enjoyed lab 5 since this was the first lab where we were enabled to use arithmetic operations in out labs. It was really fun to try and figure out how we could get the area of the rectangle inside the functions. This was different from what we had done before and it was quite refreshing to see. It was super satisfying seeing how everything tied together in the end especially how the variables all connnected in the end and the functions were quite straightforward as well.

Lab 6 Part 2
Part 2 of Lab 6 was very fun especially since I have never played blackjack before. It was fun to learn the rules and also code the game as well. I was intrigued by how the functions worked and it was also very interesting to figure out how they tied into the game. After finishing the code, I was able to test out and play blackjack which was also a fun experience. 

Lab 11 part 1
This lab was very fun since it was a combination of everything else that we had learned. There was an instance in the lab where we were using a lot of something that we had already learned on top of trying new things. For example, we used the STOD and STOI functions on top of using newer things as well. Additionally, the conditional statements were also fun to tinker with and change depending on what the assignment required.
